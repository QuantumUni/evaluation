# Evaluation

#### This is a sample project to test my programming skills in python
#### I am going to solve problems that try to cover different parts of python programming (which do not :))) )
#### This project contains following problems:
1. Create a for loop that counts all even numbers to 10
2. Create a for loop that sums the numbers from 100 to 200
3. Repeat the exercises before using a while loop and compare execution times.
4. Write a recursive Python function to calculate the factorial of a number
5. In a file timethis.py, write a decorator function timethis(func) that wraps a function with an extra layer of logic that prints out the execution time of the function. Apply this decorator to the factorial function that you create in the previous exercise. Compare this time with the execution time of math.factorial().
6. Write a function that prints out the number of lines in a text file.
7. Write a function that count the number of unique words in a file.
8. Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world
9. Solve the system of equations x0 + 2 * x1 = 1 and 3 * x0 + 5 * x1 = 2 using scipy.
10. Write a Python class Rectangle, and define two methods that return the rectangle area and perimeter, as attributes of the class.
11.
