# Evaluation

#### This is a sample project to test my programming skills in python
#### I am going to solve problems that try to cover different parts of python programming (which do not :))) )
#### This project contains following problems:
1. Create a for loop that counts all even numbers to 10
2. Create a for loop that sums the numbers from 100 to 200
3. Repeat the exercises before using a while loop and compare execution times.
4. Write a recursive Python function to calculate the factorial of a number
5. In a file timethis.py, write a decorator function timethis(func) that wraps a function with an extra layer of logic that prints out the execution time of the function. Apply this decorator to the factorial function that you create in the previous exercise. Compare this time with the execution time of math.factorial().
6. Write a function that prints out the number of lines in a text file.
7. Write a function that count the number of unique words in a file.
8. Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world
9. Solve the system of equations x0 + 2 * x1 = 1 and 3 * x0 + 5 * x1 = 2 using scipy.
10. Write a Python class Rectangle, and define two methods that return the rectangle area and perimeter, as attributes of the class.
11. A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.
Write a program to implement a Stack Data Structure using Class and Objects, with push, pop, and traversal methods.
12. A linked list is an ordered collection of values. Linked lists are similar to arrays in the sense that they contain objects in a linear order. However they differ from arrays in their memory layout. Arrays are contiguous data structures and are composed of fixed-size data records stored in adjoining blocks of memory. In an array, data is tightly packed and we know the size of each data record which allows us to quickly look up an element given its index in the array. Linked lists, however, are made up of data records linked together by pointers. This means that the data records that hold the actual “data payload” can be stored anywhere in memory. In particular, singly-linked lists are linked lists where each element has only a reference (a “pointer”) to the next element in the list, while double-linked lists also store pointers to the previous element in the list. Write a program that implements a singly-linked list with a ListNode class, and methods: append, prepend, remove, find, and reverse.
