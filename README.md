# Evaluation

#### This is a sample project to test my programming skills in python
#### I am going to solve problems that try to cover different parts of python programming (which do not :))) )
#### This project contains following problems:
- 1. Create a for loop that counts all even numbers to 10
- 2. Create a for loop that sums the numbers from 100 to 200
